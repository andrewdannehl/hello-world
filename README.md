hello world system output
My name is Andrew and I've been studying information technology with an emphasis in programming for a year now.
At this time I can write in Jave, C#, and VBA. My goal is to increase my knowledge as much as possible.
Learning has always been one of my favorite things to do. Along with problem solving.
This makes for one heck of a fit as far as developing applications. It took awhile to find what I wanted to do
for a living but I'm ecstatic I chose something that makes me truly happy.
